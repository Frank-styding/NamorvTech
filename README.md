# NamorvTech Game Engine
TypeScript Game Engine Tutorial

This project is the source code generated as part of my tutorial series on YouTube. Follow along and subscribe!

Since this project is based on WebGL, which means it is used in the browser, it uses AMD instead of CommonJS, with the outFile option when built. This means standard imports will not work. Instead, reference tags should be used by games including this library.
